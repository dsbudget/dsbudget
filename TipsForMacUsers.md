## Prerequisite ##
Install the latest Java (1.6.0).

## Installation ##
1. Download .zip file.
> This will normally download to the "Downloads" folder.

2. Double click.zip file.
> This will create a "dsbudget\_2.0.12" folder in the download folder.

3. Drag the "dsbudget\_2.0.12" to the Applications folder.
  1. Open Finder.
  1. Double click on your downloads folder (so you have 2 finder windows open).
  1. Drop the folder from the Downloads folder to the Applications Folder.

## Running the program ##

The next part might seem technical, but i made it very simplistic.

1. You need to open the Terminal program.
  1. In Applications, scroll to Utilities.
  1. Select Terminal.
2. Type the following lines (excluding the line numbers, but including the spaces).
  1. cd /Applications
  1. cd dsbudget\_2.0.12
  1. /System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/versions/1.6.0/Home/bin/java -jar dsbudget.jar
> This should open the program in your default browser.  Step 3. is long to make sure you are running the correct version of Java.

## Ending the program ##

  1. Close your browser (file should save as you go...).
  1. Select the "Terminal" program.  It should be somewhere on the desktop.
